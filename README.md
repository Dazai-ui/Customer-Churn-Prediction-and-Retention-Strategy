# Customer-Churn-Prediction-and-Retention-Strategy
This project predicts telecom customer churn using advanced machine learning models (XGBoost and Logistic Regression) based on customer demographics, services, and usage data. It segments customers by churn risk and assigns personalized retention strategies (e.g., discounts, engagement emails) to reduce churn and boost revenue retention.

The solution is available as a clean, well-documented Jupyter notebook for data science workflows and also deployed through an interactive Streamlit web app. The app enables users to input customer data, view churn risk scores, and receive actionable retention recommendations in real time.
